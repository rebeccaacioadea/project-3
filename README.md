General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive

# Seeded: 
###MERN Full Stack Application
A Plant Baby Sitting App

## Overview 
This is my third project at General Assembly as a Software Engineer Immersive course's student. We were placed in a group of 4 to worked together to design and develop a MERN full-stack application within 7 days

Seeded is a plant sitting app whereby plants' owners and plants' sitters can communicate with each others to share tips on plants, showcase their plants, look for a plant sitter or make a quick cash.
The app features lots of functionalities such as image uploading and message boards.

### Brief:

* Collaborative development using Git and GitHub
* Build a full-stack application using mongoose, express, react and node.js 
* Use Express API to serve the data from a Mongo database( MongoDB)
* Consume your API with a sepatae front-end built with React
* Be a complete project with mutliple relationships and CRUD functionality 
* Design a visually impressive Front End, with mobile responsiveness as a key element
* Be deploy online and accessible to the public

### Technologies:

* HTML
* Bulma
* SCSS
* JavaScript
* React.js and JSX 
* Express
* Node Package Manager (npm)
* Babel Transpiler
* Webpack
* MongoDB and Mongoose
* Insomnia
* VSCode
* Git 
* GitHub 
* Herokun(Deployment)


## Functionality: 
* User is able to search for the weather in any city around the world
* The background of the card showing the weather forecast changes according to how hot/ cold the city is. 

## Approach taken:
We started the project by roughly thinking about the React Application we wanted to develop. 
We had to roughly draw out our plans, thinking in details of different components we wanted to have and the functionality that we needed for this project. And then:

1. I setted up the git repository on GitHub and then I added another collaborator onto the project to give them access to it. 
2. We had only 48 hours to complete this project. We started off by pair programming setting up the basic components and BrowserRouter for our application via *VSCode Liveshare*. 
3. Since there was not enough time, we separated work and I took charge of working on the navigation bars, weather forecast and city pages


### Planning

## Endpoints
Although we had created our own API. We still needed to use other external APIs on our front-end in order to achieved the functionality we wanted such:

1. We use external API from [treffle.io](https://trefle.io/) to fletch the information about the plant.

ENDPOINT from treffle:

https://trefle.io/api/v1/plants/search?token=YOUR_TREFLE_TOKEN&q=strawberry

This is the sample of the data that is retrieved from the endpoint. It return upto 30 plants in an array

2. We also used the 


## Components and their routes

We used BrowserRouter provided by ***'react-router-dom'*** for routing the components.

## Potential future features

### Problems 


## Summary

By the end of this project, I became more confident in using public API to build a React application

Throughout this project, I have learnt:

1. Communication is vital when collaborating with others. 
2. Effectiveness of planning 
3. Importance of setting and meeting deadlines
4. Presentation skill as we had to demonstrate our demo
